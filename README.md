# Task-02: K-Means Clustering for Retail Customer Segmentation

This project implements a **K-means clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The clustering helps identify distinct customer segments, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies for marketing, sales, and customer engagement.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Customer Segmentation**: Groups customers into clusters based on similar purchasing patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales data, and prepares it for clustering.
- **Visualizations**: Generates plots to visualize the clustered data and evaluate the clustering results.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows configuration of the number of clusters (`k`) and other hyperparameters.
